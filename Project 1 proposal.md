Project 1 Proposal:

Team Members: Richard Marshall, Bryan Dickens, William Johnson

Topic: What is Meetup all about?  Using the Meetup API and Libraries to Find Out:
1.what is meetup all about?  What do people use it for the most- socializing, networking, skill development, etc?

2. Who is the user? Where are they from? Age, gender, etc.  What age group uses Meetup the most?

3. What is the lifecycle of a group?  What is the largest vs. smallest meeting? What is the lifespan of a group?  

4. User Engagement- what avg number of groups , groups per capita, who is utilizing it the best? Number of group members over time?  If people RSVP to an event, what is the likelihood they will attend the event?


To do this, we will be using the existing Meetup Library.  We expect to chart the following relationships:

headcount vs. rsvps
headcount vs. comments
oldest groups
