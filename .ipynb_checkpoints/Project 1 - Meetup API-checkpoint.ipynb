      "        \"description\": \"<p>This group is for anyone over 40 that wants to get out and socialize - mingle and meet new people - in a group with other people of similar age. We schedule regular social events that are fun and relaxing with a focus on social interaction - laughing, talking, eating, drinking, listening to music and dancing. Events are primarily located in Stark County and the surrounding areas including Wayne, Tuscarawas, Carroll, Columbiana, Mahoning, and Portage Counties. Everyone is welcome no matter where you live.</p>\\n<p>Please join us! We are a very friendly and welcoming group. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact one of the organizers.</p>\\n<p>Please post a recognizable picture; this makes it much easier to get to know (and remember) each other. If you are uncomfortable with this, please message me so I know you are not a robot or a creep. We try to provide a safe environment for socializing.&nbsp; We also wear name tags at events to facilitate socializing: if you see someone wearing a nametag, you know they are there to socialize and it is safe to go up and talk to them.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Events are for socializing and friendship. This is not a dating site. No one should ever feel pressured in any way to provide their phone number, accept a date, consume alcohol, dance, or anything else they are not comfortable with.</p>\\n<p>The group is geared toward people who do not have someone to socialize with, regardless of relationship status: Some people are not 'single' but, for a variety of reasons, do not have someone to socialize with. </p>\\n<p>While couples are allowed, it is important that each person is open to mingling and socializing with others, and also that their partner is OK with it.&nbsp; Couples that socialize only as a couple tend to put a damper on group socializing and send the wrong message: Someone that is \\\"looking\\\" will think \\\"My chances of finding someone tonight are high\\\" and that is <b>not</b> what the group is about!&nbsp; And someone that is \\\"not looking\\\" will be discouraged and think they do not belong - while that is specifically who the group is for.&nbsp; If your intent is to stick with your partner during the majority of the event, then this group really isn't for you.</p>\\n<p> If you have a suggestion for an event, please let us know! </p>\",\n",

Toastmasters teaches both with ample opportunities to give speeches to supportive members and take on leadership roles in the local club and in the district.</p>\",\n",

No one will ever have to start a sentence with any sort of apology for being a nerd <i>(because if you're a nerd, you belong here).</i></p>\\n<p>We have weekly meetings plus 1-2 events nearly every weekend. We'll go see movies, hit a comicCon, go to the planetarium, play Pok\\u00e9mon go, go for hikes, see concerts, and loads of other things that the group members get to suggest!</p>\\n<p><b>Disclaimers :)</b> <br>We require all new members to have a MeetUp profile picture showing their face. This is to reduce scammers <i>(yes, they happen)</i> and help us identify new members so we can greet them. If you do not have a profile picture showing your face, please update it :)&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>If any member is disrespectful to any venue or event host, it is grounds for that member's removal with or without warning. &nbsp;Some examples of this include (but are not limited to) not heeding warnings or directions of the event host or venue staff, rough-housing behavior, or vandalism.<br> <br>Also, we are FRIENDLY GEEKS AND GEEKETTES. Please be kind to each other. If anyone in the group is not following the golden rule, please message an organizer immediately. We are very diplomatic &amp; will review the situation. If the person is merely socially awkward or introverted <i>(two terms used with complete adoration\\u2764\\ufe0f)</i>, we will see this is a simple misunderstanding and straighten things out. However, if the person is having trouble understanding the \\\"be nice\\\" concept, they will be warned and, if needed, dealt with as the situation sees fit. This is for the benefit of the entire group.</p>\\n<p><br></p>\",\n",

The Academy of Fetish Arts is a 6500 sq. ft. facility in downtown Cleveland (2 blocks off the freeway) that was created as a gathering &amp; play space for ALL of the kinky people and Groups in N.E. Ohio and surrounding states ages 19 and over.</p> \\n<p>The Academy consists of a 2000 sq. ft. main playroom surrounded by 14 other rooms: A changing room with lockers. A conference/class room that will hold 50. There\\u2019s a connected Lounge and Breakroom for eating, drinking, socializing away from play. Dedicated rooms for fire play, medical/needle play (2), Office/interrogation scenes, a \\u201ccuddle-play\\u201d room for littles &amp; puppies, whip play area, etc. And\\u2026 3 bedrooms for aftercare/cuddles/sex.</p> \\n<p>Due to the nature of current Ohio &amp; Cleveland law, The Academy has to be a strictly \\u201cMembers Only\\u201d facility for all play parties. That also allows us to make The Academy a sex-positive facility all the time! So\\u2026 if that\\u2019s how you want to express yourself, go right ahead! (Unless a Group doesn\\u2019t choose that. Groups can restrict play for private parties if they so choose.)</p> \\n<p>We also offer munches, open houses and new to kink classes that don't require membership. We just ask for a donation to cover incidentals.</p>\",\n",

Anyone&nbsp;OVER 40 years of age is welcome to join us to explore Lake County,&nbsp;far eastern Cuyahoga County, and nearby surrounding areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>No charge for Membership.</em>&nbsp; We're about having fun, socializing, meeting new people and making new friends close to home as well as getting a closer view of our area. </p>\\n<p><b>What do we ask of you? </b> <br>1) Post, and keep, a recent lone self-identifiable photo that clearly shows your face on your group profile - a hat &amp; sunglasses&nbsp;block us from being able to identify you. How else are we to recognize and greet you at our events?&nbsp; <br></p>\\n<p>We're glad you have an interest in&nbsp;this active social group. &nbsp;It's common to be nervous about meeting new people so we find it helpful if each member creates a profile; that way event attendees can know a little about the other members of this community before meeting them. <br></p>\\n<p>2) In this day and age of the Internet, for personal security reasons, we strongly suggest that you use only your first name and the initial of your last name when creating your Meetup Account. We do not accept monikers or just&nbsp;an&nbsp;initial(s) on your group profile.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> 3)&nbsp;Be friendly and polite to our members. We are an active&nbsp;social group NOT a dating nor a singles&nbsp;site. Our membership community&nbsp;includes Individuals/Couples that are married <i>in addition to</i>&nbsp; Individuals that are single.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br>4) Please keep in mind that&nbsp;we are&nbsp;a fun social group and&nbsp;are not for anyone's&nbsp;personal business development or marketing purposes.&nbsp; Those found to be here for such purposes will be removed from this group.&nbsp; </p>\\n<p>5)&nbsp;Be sure to check the site from a desktop computer regularly, it looks a lot different. If you're only using the app, you're going to be missing out on some group/site options! </p>\\n<p>6) Inactive members are removed from this group. The whole purpose of Meetup is to actually meet up with people - isn't that why you're joining.&nbsp; Showing up makes a difference. If you don't make an effort to attend our events, that's totally up to you, but&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;you will be removed from this group for \\\"Inactivity\\\".&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\\n<p>7) Please play fair and come to the event you sign up for, or if plans change, change your RSVP.&nbsp; Multiple \\\"No Shows\\\" and last minute cancellations will result in your removal from the group.&nbsp; </p>\\n<p>8) Remember that all of us here&nbsp;as organizers are unpaid volunteers. </p>\\n<p><b>To know what Meetup.com&nbsp;requires of members:&nbsp; </b>please click on \\\"Help\\\" located at the bottom of the page, left hand side.</p>\\n<p>We hope to meet you soon and welcome you to become part of something special that is happening&nbsp;on the east side!</p>\\n<p>~<em>The Leadership Team</em></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p> <br>&nbsp; <br> <br> <br></p>\",\n",

Members of this group love soccer - all come together around a common love of the sport, no matter the skill level. The group is composed of players of all ages, backgrounds and nationalities - 18 years of age or older. We are not a league and do not compete against one another, nor do we use refs or officials. We moderate games ourselves making our own calls. We do not keep score. The group is open to all skill levels and our membership encompasses a mix of playing experience and abilities.</p>\\n<p>Each season we have multiple games to choose from, each with its own crowd and own unique character!</p>\\n<p>We hope to see you out there on the soccer field.</p>\\n<p> <br></p>\",\n",

Newbies can learn from the experienced, so dont be afraid to start something new. I started this group to meet other outdoor enthusiasts.

Come when you can, leave when you need to. These are primarily a chance to stop, have a beverage and converse. For those more passionate about Craft Beer, it's also an opportunity to explore, learn and experience what's current and new in the Craft Beer world.<span>&nbsp;Feel free to come along and invite a friend.&nbsp;</span></p>\\n<p><b>(Anti-)RULES:</b></p>\\n<p><b>1. </b>You will never be asked for dues. Just pay the venues we go to for their food, drink, activity or corkage fees. Maybe buy a beer to bring to a tasting.</p>\\n<p><b>2.</b> You don't have to be on time, unless the venue states something like \\\"The tour starts at ...\\\". Come when you can, have a beer. Leave when you feel like it.</p>\\n<p><b>3.</b> No one is pretentious. We do get to experience rare and uber tasty beers at many events. The beer or experience is the star. We just enjoy.</p>\\n<p><b>4. </b>Members get discounts! See the sponsor page. Get a free member card. Go to those places, get specials and discounts on beer.</p>\\n<p><b>5.</b> Relax, enjoy, have a beer.</p>\\n<p><b>6.</b> Although beer is mentioned in every rule, you can drink anything you like, even just water. We have members that are allergic to beer, they just enjoy being around laid back, fun people.</p>\\n<p>We also post public (<b>unhosted</b>) beer events not organized for Meetups. (More on that <b><i><a href=\\\"http://www.meetup.com/Akron-Beer/messages/boards/thread/42358852/0/#117107642\\\">here</a></i></b>.)

      "        \"description\": \"<p>This is a meetup group for vegans and those interested in becoming vegan and learning about the plant based diet or lifestyle.</p>\\n<p>We hope to promote the social and educational aspects of veganism.</p>\\n<p>Our meetup group is about getting together for meals, lectures, watching documentaries/movies, going on field trips and making some new friends!</p>\\n<p>It is always great to share information, have fun and be with like-minded people. Even if you are not yet a \\\"veggie\\\", we still welcome everyone to join us for a meet up to see how healthy and delicious vegan food can be! We welcome those who are <em>veg-curious</em>.</p>\\n<p>Vegan is more than food choices, it is a lifestyle. Vegan does not include any flesh food or animal (fowl, fish, mammal, insects, etc) of any kind. All animal products and bi products are excluded, including all dairy. Vegans do not wear flesh-made products such as leather, skins and fur. We respect all animals, our fellow creatures, and work to protect them as well as the environment. Just being vegan is a very strong environmental and ecological act, conserving water, fuel and land resources.</p>\\n<p>Some people are vegan due to health and medical reasons, some due to compassion for living a non-violent lifestyle. Some live it for ethical reasons, the sake of the animals and others. Some embrace veganism for for health reasons, some for the economy. Eating a plant-based diet is less expensive than eating flesh foods. Some vegans have allergies to flesh foods and animal fluids. There are plenty of other reasons as well! Remember, heart attacks are mother nature's revenge for eating her creatures! :-)</p>\\n<p>Our membership extends over the entire North East Ohio area from out by Cedar Point almost to Pennsylvania and as far south as you'd care to drive.</p>\\n<p>Become a member (membership is free), and come to one of the many meetups! You are a stranger but once.</p>\",\n",

WOFFs welcomes all lesbian women <b>AND </b>their women friends of any age, sexual preference or identity and truly wishes to develop a diverse community of women. </p>\\n<p>The WOFF site is intended to be used by members to post activities of interest for one another. <span>Think about what you enjoy - movies, books, current event discussions, potlucks, weekend trips, concerts, theater, volunteering, walking, biking, kayaking, working out? How about going to baseball, basketball or football games? Or playing golf, tennis or PICKLEBALL? Then take a chance and come to a WOFF activity ... or use this site to post an activity in your area! Just email me at woffmania@g\\u00admail.com and I will post your event!</span></p>\\n<p><span>Activities may be more or less restrictive than our membership (for example, some activities will include men; others may be intended only for lesbians over 50). The intended participants will be specified in the description of each activity when the other group's membership differs from ours. <br></span></p>\\n<p>Many of our single WOFFs are looking to meet other single WOFFs and many couples are looking for other couples to hang out with. Golfers want to meet golfers, kayakers want to meet kayakers, and you see where this is going. The Introduction section in your profile is a good place to let others know what you want them to know about you so that they can make a point to meet you. </p>\\n<p><b>Please be sure to RSVP to each activity you decide to attend so that we all know who to expect at an event. If you can't go after all - no worries - just change your RSVP so that we know you won't be there. Before going to an event, please be sure to check the RSVPs to make sure someone else will be there! I know it is no fun going somewhere looking forward to being with friends and then there is no one there.</b></p>\\n<p><b>About Dues: Dues pay for site, event and supply costs. Now that I have been reimbursed for&nbsp; dues and expenses since 2013, what remains each year will fund activities. If you are interested in being part of a committee that decides how that money is spent, please email me at woffmania@gmail.com. If you cannot afford to pay or choose not to, please just email me that information and I will mark you as \\\"exempt from dues\\\". Woffmania@gmail.com is my &nbsp;personal email address so no one else will see what you email there. You may also mail your dues - just email me and I will send you the address.</b> <br></p>\\n<p><span>Finally, please do not hesitate to email (woffmania@g\\u00admail.com) or call me if you have a suggestion or need help using the site. My phone number is posted in my profile.</span></p>\\n<p>Beth <br> <br></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\",\n",
