Searches with a query return up to 10 cities matching the term, and can be sorted by size or distance to a given coordinate. 'smart' ordering can be used to return the match(es) with the highest member_count, unless a smaller size match exists nearby the given coordinates. Query searches are supported for country but not country and state\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"<p>This group is for anyone over 40 that wants to get out and socialize - mingle and meet new people - in a group with other people of similar age. We schedule regular social events that are fun and relaxing with a focus on social interaction - laughing, talking, eating, drinking, listening to music and dancing. Events are primarily located in Stark County and the surrounding areas including Wayne, Tuscarawas, Carroll, Columbiana, Mahoning, and Portage Counties. Everyone is welcome no matter where you live.</p>\\n<p>Please join us! We are a very friendly and welcoming group. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact one of the organizers.</p>\\n<p>Please post a recognizable picture; this makes it much easier to get to know (and remember) each other. If you are uncomfortable with this, please message me so I know you are not a robot or a creep. We try to provide a safe environment for socializing.&nbsp; We also wear name tags at events to facilitate socializing: if you see someone wearing a nametag, you know they are there to socialize and it is safe to go up and talk to them.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Events are for socializing and friendship. This is not a dating site. No one should ever feel pressured in any way to provide their phone number, accept a date, consume alcohol, dance, or anything else they are not comfortable with.</p>\\n<p>The group is geared toward people who do not have someone to socialize with, regardless of relationship status: Some people are not 'single' but, for a variety of reasons, do not have someone to socialize with. </p>\\n<p>While couples are allowed, it is important that each person is open to mingling and socializing with others, and also that their partner is OK with it.&nbsp; Couples that socialize only as a couple tend to put a damper on group socializing and send the wrong message: Someone that is \\\"looking\\\" will think \\\"My chances of finding someone tonight are high\\\" and that is <b>not</b> what the group is about!&nbsp; And someone that is \\\"not looking\\\" will be discouraged and think they do not belong - while that is specifically who the group is for.&nbsp; If your intent is to stick with your partner during the majority of the event, then this group really isn't for you.</p>\\n<p> If you have a suggestion for an event, please let us know! </p>\",\n",

      "        \"description\": \"<p><span>Friendly Geeks of Greater Cleveland is a group for young and middle-aged adults who are nerds, geeks, and quite possibly dorks.</span> <br></p>\\n<p><span>We like Star Trek, Star Wars, Doctor Who, The Big Bang Theory, New Girl, Sherlock Holmes, X-files, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Monty Python, The Outer Limits, Farscape, The Walking Dead, Princess Bride, Twilight Zone, Pride and Prejudice, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, science, biology, technology, coloring books, artists, superhero movies, comic books, video games, anime, comiccons, puns, pirates, ninjas, zombies, and maybe even vampires.</span></p>\\n<p>This is a group of people who want to hang out with other people who like these things too and get a bunch of people together who like imaginative, crazy, fun things. No one will ever have to start a sentence with any sort of apology for being a nerd <i>(because if you're a nerd, you belong here).</i></p>\\n<p>We have weekly meetings plus 1-2 events nearly every weekend. We'll go see movies, hit a comicCon, go to the planetarium, play Pok\\u00e9mon go, go for hikes, see concerts, and loads of other things that the group members get to suggest!</p>\\n<p><b>Disclaimers :)</b> <br>We require all new members to have a MeetUp profile picture showing their face. This is to reduce scammers <i>(yes, they happen)</i> and help us identify new members so we can greet them. If you do not have a profile picture showing your face, please update it :)&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>If any member is disrespectful to any venue or event host, it is grounds for that member's removal with or without warning. &nbsp;Some examples of this include (but are not limited to) not heeding warnings or directions of the event host or venue staff, rough-housing behavior, or vandalism.<br> <br>Also, we are FRIENDLY GEEKS AND GEEKETTES. Please be kind to each other. If anyone in the group is not following the golden rule, please message an organizer immediately. We are very diplomatic &amp; will review the situation. If the person is merely socially awkward or introverted <i>(two terms used with complete adoration\\u2764\\ufe0f)</i>, we will see this is a simple misunderstanding and straighten things out. However, if the person is having trouble understanding the \\\"be nice\\\" concept, they will be warned and, if needed, dealt with as the situation sees fit. This is for the benefit of the entire group.</p>\\n<p><br></p>\",\n",

You are welcome to us WePay which associated with meetup.com, pay via PayPal to bipiltd@gmail.com, or can pay with cash if you see Tiki Bob (Burrows) in person. &nbsp;The WePay option does take a sizable portion of the donation in transaction fees, so we prefer the other two options. &nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In the past, we have focused on outdoor sand/beach volleyball, and have tried to keep our events free whenever possible. &nbsp;We would like to also offer indoor options during the colder months and are looking for indoor host locations. &nbsp;It is significantly harder to location indoor facilities willing to donate the use of their space, so we may try out some pay-to-play pickups to cover the cost to rent out court time.</p>\",\n",

Anyone&nbsp;OVER 40 years of age is welcome to join us to explore Lake County,&nbsp;far eastern Cuyahoga County, and nearby surrounding areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>No charge for Membership.</em>&nbsp; We're about having fun, socializing, meeting new people and making new friends close to home as well as getting a closer view of our area. </p>\\n<p><b>What do we ask of you? </b> <br>1) Post, and keep, a recent lone self-identifiable photo that clearly shows your face on your group profile - a hat &amp; sunglasses&nbsp;block us from being able to identify you. How else are we to recognize and greet you at our events?&nbsp; <br></p>\\n<p>We're glad you have an interest in&nbsp;this active social group. &nbsp;It's common to be nervous about meeting new people so we find it helpful if each member creates a profile; that way event attendees can know a little about the other members of this community before meeting them. <br></p>\\n<p>2) In this day and age of the Internet, for personal security reasons, we strongly suggest that you use only your first name and the initial of your last name when creating your Meetup Account. We do not accept monikers or just&nbsp;an&nbsp;initial(s) on your group profile.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> 3)&nbsp;Be friendly and polite to our members. We are an active&nbsp;social group NOT a dating nor a singles&nbsp;site. Our membership community&nbsp;includes Individuals/Couples that are married <i>in addition to</i>&nbsp; Individuals that are single.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <br>4) Please keep in mind that&nbsp;we are&nbsp;a fun social group and&nbsp;are not for anyone's&nbsp;personal business development or marketing purposes.&nbsp; Those found to be here for such purposes will be removed from this group.&nbsp; </p>\\n<p>5)&nbsp;Be sure to check the site from a desktop computer regularly, it looks a lot different. If you're only using the app, you're going to be missing out on some group/site options! </p>\\n<p>6) Inactive members are removed from this group. The whole purpose of Meetup is to actually meet up with people - isn't that why you're joining.&nbsp; Showing up makes a difference. If you don't make an effort to attend our events, that's totally up to you, but&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;you will be removed from this group for \\\"Inactivity\\\".&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\\n<p>7) Please play fair and come to the event you sign up for, or if plans change, change your RSVP.&nbsp; Multiple \\\"No Shows\\\" and last minute cancellations will result in your removal from the group.&nbsp; </p>\\n<p>8) Remember that all of us here&nbsp;as organizers are unpaid volunteers. </p>\\n<p><b>To know what Meetup.com&nbsp;requires of members:&nbsp; </b>please click on \\\"Help\\\" located at the bottom of the page, left hand side.</p>\\n<p>We hope to meet you soon and welcome you to become part of something special that is happening&nbsp;on the east side!</p>\\n<p>~<em>The Leadership Team</em></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p> <br></p>\\n<p> <br>&nbsp; <br> <br> <br></p>\",\n",

Just pay the venues we go to for their food, drink, activity or corkage fees. Maybe buy a beer to bring to a tasting.</p>\\n<p><b>2.</b> You don't have to be on time, unless the venue states something like \\\"The tour starts at ...\\\". Come when you can, have a beer. Leave when you feel like it.</p>\\n<p><b>3.</b> No one is pretentious. We do get to experience rare and uber tasty beers at many events. The beer or experience is the star. We just enjoy.</p>\\n<p><b>4. </b>Members get discounts! See the sponsor page. Get a free member card.

      "        \"description\": \"<p>This is a meetup group for vegans and those interested in becoming vegan and learning about the plant based diet or lifestyle.</p>\\n<p>We hope to promote the social and educational aspects of veganism.</p>\\n<p>Our meetup group is about getting together for meals, lectures, watching documentaries/movies, going on field trips and making some new friends!</p>\\n<p>It is always great to share information, have fun and be with like-minded people. Even if you are not yet a \\\"veggie\\\", we still welcome everyone to join us for a meet up to see how healthy and delicious vegan food can be! We welcome those who are <em>veg-curious</em>.</p>\\n<p>Vegan is more than food choices, it is a lifestyle. Vegan does not include any flesh food or animal (fowl, fish, mammal, insects, etc) of any kind. All animal products and bi products are excluded, including all dairy. Vegans do not wear flesh-made products such as leather, skins and fur. We respect all animals, our fellow creatures, and work to protect them as well as the environment. Just being vegan is a very strong environmental and ecological act, conserving water, fuel and land resources.</p>\\n<p>Some people are vegan due to health and medical reasons, some due to compassion for living a non-violent lifestyle. Some live it for ethical reasons, the sake of the animals and others. Some embrace veganism for for health reasons, some for the economy. Eating a plant-based diet is less expensive than eating flesh foods. Some vegans have allergies to flesh foods and animal fluids. There are plenty of other reasons as well! Remember, heart attacks are mother nature's revenge for eating her creatures! :-)</p>\\n<p>Our membership extends over the entire North East Ohio area from out by Cedar Point almost to Pennsylvania and as far south as you'd care to drive.</p>\\n<p>Become a member (membership is free), and come to one of the many meetups! You are a stranger but once.</p>\",\n",

WOFFs welcomes all lesbian women <b>AND </b>their women friends of any age, sexual preference or identity and truly wishes to develop a diverse community of women. </p>\\n<p>The WOFF site is intended to be used by members to post activities of interest for one another. <span>Think about what you enjoy - movies, books, current event discussions, potlucks, weekend trips, concerts, theater, volunteering, walking, biking, kayaking, working out? How about going to baseball, basketball or football games? Or playing golf, tennis or PICKLEBALL? Then take a chance and come to a WOFF activity ... or use this site to post an activity in your area! Just email me at woffmania@g\\u00admail.com and I will post your event!</span></p>\\n<p><span>Activities may be more or less restrictive than our membership (for example, some activities will include men; others may be intended only for lesbians over 50). The intended participants will be specified in the description of each activity when the other group's membership differs from ours. <br></span></p>\\n<p>Many of our single WOFFs are looking to meet other single WOFFs and many couples are looking for other couples to hang out with. Golfers want to meet golfers, kayakers want to meet kayakers, and you see where this is going. The Introduction section in your profile is a good place to let others know what you want them to know about you so that they can make a point to meet you. </p>\\n<p><b>Please be sure to RSVP to each activity you decide to attend so that we all know who to expect at an event. If you can't go after all - no worries - just change your RSVP so that we know you won't be there. Before going to an event, please be sure to check the RSVPs to make sure someone else will be there!

Now that I have been reimbursed for&nbsp; dues and expenses since 2013, what remains each year will fund activities. If you are interested in being part of a committee that decides how that money is spent, please email me at woffmania@gmail.com. If you cannot afford to pay or choose not to, please just email me that information and I will mark you as \\\"exempt from dues\\\". Woffmania@gmail.com is my &nbsp;personal email address so no one else will see what you email there. You may also mail your dues - just email me and I will send you the address.</b> <br></p>\\n<p><span>Finally, please do not hesitate to email (woffmania@g\\u00admail.com) or call me if you have a suggestion or need help using the site.
